3rd DISCIPLINE.  KEEP A COMPELLING SCOREBOARD People and teams play differently when they are keeping score, and the right kind of scoreboards motivate the players to win. People play differently when they are keeping score. If you doubt this, watch a group of teenagers playing basketball. See how the game changes the minute score-keeping begins, it’s not a subtle change.     The lag and lead measures won’t have much meaning to the team unless they can see the progress in real time. Bowling through a curtain is not that much fun. Discipline 3 is the discipline of engagement. People perform best when they are emotionally engaged and the highest level of engagement comes when people who the score: whether they are winning or losing the game. It's that simple.  “Great teams know at every moment whether or not they are winning. They must know, otherwise, they don’t know what they have to do to win the game.”  CHRIS MCCHESNEY    The best scoreboard is designed for, and often by the players. A player’s scoreboard is quite different from the complex scoreboard that coaches love to make. If players know the score, if they can influence the lead measure and if the lead measure moves the lag measures, you know you have a winnable game. Disciplines 1, 2 and 3 are nothing more than a formula for creating a winnable game. Discipline 4 is how we play that game.
